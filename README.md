# underscores heardle
**A replica of Heardle, but with songs by underscores.**

## But... Why?
To start, this was created for the [daily underscores heardle series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAEc0HKmIWO-oDNPLi1aL1aazsqdxYhPg), which started by using [shelly's](https://not.apictureof.me) version of the [underscores Heardle](https://heardle.apictureof.me/).

Most clones of Heardle use Soundcloud only for their backend, which is fine, except that after doing the Heardle 100 times, I started to get the same songs over and over again, which didn't make the videos very interesting. So I decided I'd add some absolutely ridiculous songs to the list, and here we are.

## How To Play
1. Go to the [underscores heardle website](https://heardle.orchards.dev) 
2. If you don't know how to play, click the question mark in the navbar
3. That's pretty much it
4. I don't really know what else to add here it's just a like any other Heardle lol

## Running Locally
If you want to run this locally instead (maybe because you want to change the songs or something), you can do so by following these steps:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start a development server
4. Go to `localhost:5000` in your browser!

Basically, treat it like any other Next.JS project

## Contributing
You are more than welcome to contribute to the Heardle-ing (I'm making that a word now). Mostly I might need help with design (especially around mobile devices), so by all means feel free to open up a pull request!

I will just ask that you don't add songs to the song list. But, if you want to fork this and make your own Heardle with a different artists songs, absolutely go for it!
